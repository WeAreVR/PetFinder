The goal with the dataset can be read here
https://www.kaggle.com/c/petfinder-pawpularity-score/data

The first few lines should not be run unless you lost the dataset
The functions that finds duplicates does not delete images, but just remove them from the dataset during runtime. Skip it if you need to run the entire code as it takes a long time to run. Atleast until we implement a functions that deletes them


Next to do
- [ ] Data Preprocessing
- [ ] Simple Model so we can test the augments
